1 ||| sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too .

0 ||| most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
0 ||| to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .

1 ||| both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . 
1 ||| sweet and memorable film . 
0 |||  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
1 ||| i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
0 ||| a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
1 ||| leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
1 ||| just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .

1 ||| anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film . 
1 ||| a film that will enthrall the whole family . 
1 ||| it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1 ### . 2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza . 
0 ||| a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
1 ||| a sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter . 
0 ||| it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
0 ||| what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
1 ||| the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
0 ||| there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
1 ||| directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .

0 ||| every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
1 ||| occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
1 |||  . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
0 ||| because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
0 ||| [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
0 ||| the script ? please . 
0 ||| shrewd but pointless . 
1 ||| performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
0 ||| there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
1 ||| the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
0 ||| there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
0 ||| the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
0 ||| the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
1 ||| the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams . 
1 ||| a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 ### british production .

1 ||| you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
1 ||| reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
0 ||| more maudlin than sharp . 
1 ||| neatly constructed thriller . 
1 ||| the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
0 |||  " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humorï¿½it's just plain bored . 
0 ||| like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
1 ||| like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . 
1 ||| this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned . 
0 ||| if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
1 ||| the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
1 ||| one of the greatest films i've ever seen . 
0 ||| a film that loses sight of its own story . 
0 ||| an uplifting , largely bogus story . 
0 ||| adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
1 ||| a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
0 ||| there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
1 ||| francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them . 
0 ||| it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
1 ||| like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
0 ||| there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
0 ||| forget the psychology 101 ### study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
0 ||| cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
0 ||| schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
0 ||| a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
0 ||| it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
0 ||| not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
0 ||| the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
0 ||| it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
0 ||| the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
0 ||| 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
1 ||| while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it's awfully entertaining to watch . 
0 ||| there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
0 ||| its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
0 ||| it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
0 ||| i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
0 ||| a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
0 ||| to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
0 ||| hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
0 ||| tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
1 ||| never once predictable . 
1 ||| meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
0 ||| one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
0 ||| so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
1 ||| tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
1 ||| funny and touching . 
1 ||| 'barbershop " is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story . 
0 ||| charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
1 ||| [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
1 ||| though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
1 ||| hardly a film that comes along every day . 
0 ||| cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
1 ||| it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at . 
0 ||| the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
0 ||| the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
0 ||| there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
1 ||| a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
1 ||| with the film's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved . 
1 ||| there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
1 ||| has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 
1 ||| may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
1 ||| fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm . 
1 ||| this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
1 ||| audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
0 ||| it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
1 ||| good-naturedly cornball sequel .

1 ||| has its share of arresting images . 
0 ||| characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
0 |||  . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
1 ||| together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . 
1 ||| insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
0 ||| a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
0 |||  . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
1 ||| it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
1 ||| sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching . 
1 ||| a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
0 ||| hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
1 ||| rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue . 
1 |||  . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
0 ||| imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
1 ||| as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr . lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 
1 ||| presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
1 ||| fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
0 ||| seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
1 ||| the movie's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman's barking-mad taylor to thewlis's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell's hard-eyed gangster . 
1 ||| cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective . 
1 ||| not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
0 |||  " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
1 ||| the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger . 
0 ||| if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
1 ||| the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
0 ||| a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
0 ||| the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
1 ||| if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
1 ||| it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
1 ||| what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
0 ||| irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
0 ||| this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does .

0 ||| swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
0 ||| it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
1 ||| deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame . 
1 ||| it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days . 
1 ||| some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain . 
1 ||| the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
0 ||| by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
1 ||| if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
1 ||| it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well . 
1 ||| its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
0 ||| it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
0 |||  . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
1 ||| nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while . 
1 ||| based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
0 ||| contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
0 ||| schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
0 ||| nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
1 ||| genuinely unnerving . 
0 ||| at once half-baked and overheated . 
0 ||| put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
1 ||| it's mostly a pleasure to watch . and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . 
0 ||| there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
1 ||| a solidly seaworthy chiller . 
0 ||| feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
1 ||| a very capable nailbiter . 
1 ||| allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
0 ||| labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
0 ||| personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
0 ||| they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
0 ||| no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
0 ||| it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
1 ||| executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
0 ||| very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
0 ||| when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
1 ||| it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
0 ||| another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
1 ||| at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
0 ||| they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
1 ||| this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters . 
0 ||| it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
0 ||| ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
1 ||| a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
0 ||| yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
0 ||| every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
0 ||| crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
1 ||| gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
1 ||| ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up . 
0 ||| twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
0 ||| it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
0 ||| as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
0 ||| as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
1 ||| [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
1 ||| the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
0 ||| the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
1 ||| led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 
1 ||| when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language . 
0 ||| the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
0 ||| yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
1 ||| takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
1 ||| anchored by friel and williams's exceptional performances , the film's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white . 
1 ||| when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve . 
1 ||| el peso de un lï¿½quido incoloro , el peso del lï¿½quido vital , del amor como elemento de vida , y de muerte . . . 
0 ||| a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars . 
0 ||| although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
1 ||| a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . 
0 ||| a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 ### minutes after the last trombone honks . 
0 ||| a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
1 ||| that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
0 ||| as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
0 ||| anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
0 ||| just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
0 ||| both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
1 ||| heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
1 ||| savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
1 ||| the movie is well done , but slow . 
0 ||| so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
1 ||| tends to pile too many " serious issues " on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written . 
0 ||| this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
0 ||| the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
0 ||| a lame comedy . 
1 ||| [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
0 ||| the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
1 ||| parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into buï¿½uel's casings
1 ||| bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability . 
1 ||| chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
1 |||  ( danny huston gives ) an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk . 
0 ||| it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
1 ||| you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
1 ||| [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
0 ||| despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
0 ||| even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
1 ||| romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
0 ||| can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
0 |||  . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
1 ||| while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
0 ||| like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
1 ||| one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
0 ||| may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
0 ||| what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
1 ||| it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
0 ||| if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
1 ||| exhilarating , funny and fun . 
0 ||| stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text ï¿½ when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
0 ||| oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
0 ||| i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
0 ||| it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 ### minutes . 
0 |||  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
0 ||| de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
0 ||| new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
0 ||| crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
1 ||| blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . 
1 ||| audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling . 
0 ||| given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
0 ||| miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
1 ||| reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
1 ||| fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . 
1 ||| a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle . 
1 ||| what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
1 ||| a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . 
1 ||| an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
1 ||| it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
0 ||| one thing's for sureï¿½if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
0 ||| hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
1 ||| you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 
1 ||| there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
0 ||| never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
1 ||| this is one of polanski's best films . 
0 ||| it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
0 ||| the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 ### minutes . 
0 ||| represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
0 ||| this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
1 ||| a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you cannot separate them . 
0 ||| i hate this movie
0 ||| bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
1 ||| harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
0 ||| lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
0 ||| a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
1 ||| delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity . 
1 ||| an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
1 ||| best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man . 
1 ||| like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
1 ||| playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
1 ||| manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
1 ||| this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
1 ||| despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
0 ||| this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 ### . 
1 ||| like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 
0 ||| twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
1 ||| the dramatic crisis doesn't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but huppert's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience . 
1 ||| foster and whitaker are especially fine . she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew . 
1 ||| the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
1 ||| a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
0 ||| certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
1 ||| imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made . 
0 ||| there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
1 ||| despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
0 ||| lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
1 ||| y tu mamï¿½ tambiï¿½n is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
0 ||| bottom-rung new jack city wannabe . 
0 ||| a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
0 ||| sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
1 ||| what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
0 ||| as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
1 ||| it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
1 ||| a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . 
0 ||| a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
1 ||| highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
0 ||| it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
1 ||| you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
0 ||| more trifle than triumph . 
0 ||| the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
0 ||| a movie to forget
0 ||| this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
0 ||| this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
0 ||| even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
0 ||| it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
1 ||| an escapist confection that's pure entertainment . 
1 ||| shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
0 ||| rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
1 ||| has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
1 ||| the entire cast is extraordinarily good . 
0 ||| don't even bother to rent this on video . 
1 ||| spare yet audacious . . . 
0 ||| mild , meandering teen flick . 
1 ||| majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
0 ||| just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
1 ||| illuminating if overly talky documentary . 
1 ||| even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 
0 ||| dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
0 |||  . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
0 ||| [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
1 ||| all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely . 
0 ||| been there done that . 
1 ||| stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
0 ||| terrible . 
0 |||  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
0 ||| can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
1 ||| the result is more depressing than liberating , but it's never boring . 
0 ||| the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
0 ||| none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
1 ||| boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time . 
1 ||| sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodramï¿½ticos para arrancar lï¿½grimas do espectador , o pianista ï¿½ um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante . 
1 ||| parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
0 ||| the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
1 ||| in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
1 ||| it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 ### screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
1 ||| the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
0 ||| a pretentious mess . 
1 ||| i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
0 ||| i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
1 ||| martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
0 ||| de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
1 ||| is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ? as hannibal would say , yes , 'it's like having an old friend for dinner' . 
0 ||| like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
1 ||| most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
1 ||| like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 
0 ||| with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
1 ||| chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
0 ||| a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
1 ||| a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
1 ||| the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
0 ||| this is nothing but familiar territory . 
1 ||| creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget . 
1 ||| those of you who don't believe in santa claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original . well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts . 
1 ||| a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
1 |||  ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
1 ||| [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
0 ||| a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
1 ||| a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . 
0 ||| despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
0 ||| nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
0 ||| the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
1 ||| probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis . 
1 ||| handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . 
1 ||| nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
0 ||| kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
0 ||| here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
0 ||| on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
1 ||| you don't need to know your ice-t's from your cool-j's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . 
0 ||| a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
0 ||| humor in i spy is so anemic . 
0 ||| will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
1 ||| fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply . 
1 ||| a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships . 
1 ||| this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful . 
0 ||| needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
0 ||| if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
1 ||| the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
1 ||| charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie . 
0 ||| literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 ### minutes . 
1 ||| farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 
0 ||| elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
1 ||| a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact . 
1 ||| kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
1 ||| the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on bï¿½ttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
0 ||| all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
1 ||| not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
0 ||| without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelstrï¿½m is just another winter sleepers . 
1 ||| though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
1 ||| leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
0 ||| strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
1 ||| in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
1 ||| smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
1 ||| it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
0 ||| woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
1 ||| in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good . 
0 ||| the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
0 ||| it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
1 ||| its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
1 ||| there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country . 
0 ||| it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
1 ||| a lovely film for the holiday season . 
1 ||| a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
1 ||| a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout . 
1 ||| very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
0 ||| low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
0 ||| this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
0 ||| the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
0 ||| you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
0 ||| sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
1 ||| a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
0 ||| snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
0 ||| the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
0 ||| there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 ### minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
1 ||| a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
0 ||| soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
1 ||| frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
1 ||| even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
0 ||| an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
0 ||| shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
1 ||| [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
1 ||| proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
0 ||| a sometimes tedious film . 
1 ||| by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best . 
0 ||| it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
1 ||| with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
1 ||| you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
0 ||| first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
0 ||| the chï¿½teau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
1 ||| this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted . 
0 ||| they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
0 ||| an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
0 ||| the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
1 ||| it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
1 ||| an enjoyable above average summer diversion . 
1 ||| all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based . 
1 ||| apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
1 ||| it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
0 ||| the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
1 ||| there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
0 ||| ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
1 |||  . . . one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages . . . 
0 ||| queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
0 ||| to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
1 ||| every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy
0 ||| that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
1 ||| a marvel like none you've seen . 
1 ||| it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
0 ||| frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
1 ||| para hitler , o mundo era sua tela ; e o horror , seu pincel . e max retrata este fato com elegante abandono , numa triste constataï¿½ï¿½o da realidade histï¿½rica . 
0 ||| a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
1 |||  . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
1 ||| like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
1 ||| a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure . 
0 ||| a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
0 ||| this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1 ||| there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
0 ||| the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
1 ||| the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies . 
1 ||| it's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair . 
0 |||  . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
0 ||| when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
0 |||  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
1 ||| so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise . 
0 ||| this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
1 ||| if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 
1 ||| post 9/11 ### the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
0 ||| its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
1 ||| poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
1 ||| amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 
1 |||  " mostly martha " is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see . 
0 ||| there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
1 ||| what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
1 ||| [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
1 ||| intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being . 
1 ||| swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
1 ||| fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life . 
0 ||| donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
0 ||| the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
0 ||| in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags . 
0 ||| what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
0 ||| it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
0 |||  . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
1 ||| lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 ### minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
1 ||| a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . 
0 ||| divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
1 ||| a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
0 |||  . . . a rather bland affair . 
0 ||| if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
0 ||| a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
1 ||| a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
0 ||| the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
1 ||| knows how to make our imagination wonder . 
1 ||| the saturation bombing of reggio's images and glass' evocative music . . . ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning . 
1 ||| when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
0 ||| the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
1 ||| macdowell . . . gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done . 
1 ||| hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare . 
0 ||| fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
0 ||| the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
1 ||| a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi . 
1 ||| i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
0 ||| apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
0 ||| the film is flat . 
1 ||| grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect . 
1 ||| the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
1 ||| maguire is a surprisingly effective peter/spider-man . 
1 ||| much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . 
1 ||| it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
0 |||  " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
1 ||| a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
0 ||| one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
1 ||| though it's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves . 
1 ||| against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine . 
0 ||| flat , misguided comedy . 
0 ||| piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
0 ||| all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
0 ||| has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
1 ||| pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . 
1 ||| if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
0 ||| feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
0 ||| the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
0 ||| a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
1 ||| the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
0 ||| the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 ### miles to graceland . 
0 ||| the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
1 ||| garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
1 ||| there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
1 ||| the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
1 ||| beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
1 ||| the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
1 ||| less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
1 ||| is office work really as alienating as 'bartleby' so effectively makes it ? 
0 ||| did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
1 ||| like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
0 ||| if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
1 ||| obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
0 ||| i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
0 ||| the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
0 ||| even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
0 ||| tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
0 ||| about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
1 ||| a breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat . 
1 ||| [howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting . 
1 ||| that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications . 
0 ||| manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . 
0 ||| it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
0 ||| stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
1 ||| those who don't entirely 'get' godard's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy . 
1 ||| an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds . 
0 ||| faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
0 ||| the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
1 ||| the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
0 ||| city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
0 ||| too slow , too long and too little happens . 
1 ||| sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
0 ||| this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
0 ||| mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
0 ||| well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
0 ||| the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
1 ||| michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he's got as potent a topic as ever here . 
0 ||| toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
0 ||| davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
0 |||  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
0 ||| myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
1 ||| tells a fascinating , compelling story . 
0 ||| glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
0 ||| really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
1 ||| fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees . 
1 ||| the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
0 ||| in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
0 ||| an opportunity missed . 
1 ||| provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
0 ||| it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
1 ||| halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema , but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . 
1 ||| maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors . 
1 ||| a deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . 
0 ||| a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
1 ||| contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
0 ||| the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
0 ||| in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
1 ||| an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles . 
0 ||| as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
1 ||| 10 ### minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
1 ||| it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
0 ||| whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
1 ||| stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 ### . 
0 ||| automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
1 ||| it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness . 
1 ||| some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time . 
1 ||| it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
1 ||| charming and witty , it's also somewhat clumsy . 
1 ||| an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
0 ||| it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
1 ||| if you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here's a fun one . 
1 ||| with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism . 
0 ||| though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
0 ||| kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
1 ||| with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
1 ||| transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
0 |||  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 ### minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
1 ||| while there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it doesn't . 
0 ||| a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
1 ||| tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
1 ||| there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . 
1 ||| deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 
0 ||| comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
1 ||| when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
1 ||| what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
1 ||| director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo . it is not what you see , it is what you think you see . 
0 ||| lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
0 ||| sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
0 ||| less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
0 ||| moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
1 ||| pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel . 
0 ||| skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
1 ||| [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
1 ||| it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
0 ||| a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
1 ||| entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
0 ||| watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
0 ||| sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
1 ||| as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
1 ||| an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 
0 ||| the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
0 ||| these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
0 ||| though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
1 ||| [washington's] strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene . 
1 ||| the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
1 ||| miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
0 ||| bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
0 ||| what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
1 ||| the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
0 ||| ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
1 ||| richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez . 
0 ||| occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
1 ||| a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
0 ||| despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
0 ||| just a kiss is a just a waste . 
0 ||| obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
0 ||| i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
0 ||| it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
0 ||| the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
0 ||| behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
0 ||| this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
0 ||| well-meant but unoriginal . 
1 ||| a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith . 
1 ||| throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another . 
0 ||| guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
1 ||| the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
0 ||| the film is like sitting in a downtown cafï¿½ , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
0 ||| unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
0 ||| in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 ### sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
1 ||| daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
1 ||| somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
1 ||| a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
0 ||| press the delete key . 
0 ||| what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
0 ||| too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
0 ||| in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
0 ||| even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
1 ||| an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
0 ||| an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
0 ||| lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
1 ||| it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart . 
0 ||| it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
0 ||| lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
1 ||| a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills . 
1 ||| it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
0 ||| boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
0 ||| never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
1 ||| morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
1 ||| quietly engaging . 
0 ||| the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
0 ||| beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
0 ||| it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
1 ||| it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 
0 ||| a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
0 ||| maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
0 ||| this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
0 ||| we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
0 ||| the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
0 ||| narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
0 ||| this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
1 ||| slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 
0 ||| as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
0 ||| although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
1 ||| there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that's hard to resist . 
1 |||  . . . as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement . 
1 ||| the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
0 ||| the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
1 ||| a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
0 ||| ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
1 ||| an energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up . 
1 ||| features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
0 |||  . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
1 ||| the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 
0 ||| wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
0 ||| just one bad idea after another . 
0 ||| most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
1 ||| eric byler's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations . . . 
0 ||| a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
1 ||| efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
0 ||| a sour , nasty offering . 
1 ||| a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002's first great film
0 ||| too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
0 ||| this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
1 ||| it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
0 ||| hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
1 ||| by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
1 ||| although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
1 |||  . . . a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll . 
0 ||| there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
0 ||| the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
1 ||| the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film . 
1 |||  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
0 ||| a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
1 ||| franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
1 ||| as it turns out , you can go home again . 
0 ||| there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
1 ||| [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
1 ||| the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
0 ||| there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
0 ||| a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
1 ||| over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . 
1 ||| offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
1 ||| it's a masterpiece . 
0 ||| flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
1 ||| a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours . 
0 ||| true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
1 ||| 'frailty " starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme . 
0 ||| cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
1 ||| good , solid storytelling . 
1 ||| while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at . 
1 ||| [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
0 ||| fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
0 ||| completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
1 |||  . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . 
1 ||| on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
1 ||| 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
0 ||| in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
1 ||| it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction . 
1 ||| about schmidt is nicholson's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear . 
0 ||| helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
0 ||| fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
1 ||| a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
1 ||| not a bad journey at all . 
1 ||| effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . 
0 ||| i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
1 ||| an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
0 ||| while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
1 ||| who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you . 
1 ||| blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
1 ||| brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
1 ||| saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion . 
1 ||| worth a look as a curiosity . 
1 ||| now trimmed by about 20 ### minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . 
1 ||| broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
1 ||| schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past . 
0 ||| like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
0 ||| a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
1 ||| this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
0 ||| derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
0 ||| the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
1 ||| what sets ms . birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
0 ||| sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
0 ||| becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
0 ||| the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
1 ||| moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
0 ||| an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
1 ||| you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both . 
1 ||| a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession ï¿½ one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
1 ||| the beauty of alexander payne's ode to the everyman is in the details . 
0 ||| vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
1 ||| the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
0 ||| sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
1 ||| watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . 
0 ||| for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
0 ||| it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
1 ||| polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . 
1 ||| sweet home alabama " is what it is ï¿½ a nice , harmless date film . . . 
1 ||| wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse . 
1 ||| without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 
1 ||| light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
1 ||| schï¿½tte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 
0 ||| anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 
0 ||| but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . 
1 ||| a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
1 ||| the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon . 
0 |||  . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
1 ||| [haynes'] homage to such films as " all that heaven allows " and " imitation of life " transcends them . simply put , " far from heaven " is a masterpiece . 
0 ||| none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
1 ||| it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
1 ||| diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
0 ||| there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
0 ||| has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ï¿½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
0 ||| a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
0 ||| will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . . 
0 ||| had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
0 ||| been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
0 ||| for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
1 ||| drug abuse , infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare , but turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst . 
1 ||| as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
1 ||| unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
0 ||| while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
1 ||| parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
1 ||| an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
0 ||| large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
1 ||| the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary . 
0 ||| what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
1 ||| a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
1 ||| nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 
0 ||| laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
1 ||| a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
1 ||| a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion . 
0 ||| on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
0 |||  . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
0 ||| a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
1 ||| unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
0 ||| the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
1 ||| manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
1 ||| an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection . 
1 ||| one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
1 ||| an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
1 ||| the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we're drawn in by the dark luster . 
0 ||| an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
0 ||| in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 ### minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
0 ||| it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
1 ||| australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
0 ||| the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
0 ||| american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
1 ||| brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
0 ||| the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
1 ||| bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness . 
1 ||| steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it . 
1 ||| scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . 
1 ||| an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
0 ||| i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
1 ||| a solidly entertaining little film . 
1 ||| it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
1 ||| the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
0 ||| a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
1 ||| a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
1 ||| the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
1 ||| dog soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it . 
0 ||| other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
1 ||| the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
0 ||| the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
0 ||| the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
0 ||| a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
1 ||| it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
1 ||| as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
1 ||| it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
0 ||| you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
1 ||| an entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart . 
0 ||| in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
0 ||| always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
1 ||| spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 ### years later . 
0 ||| a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
1 ||| sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts . 
1 ||| the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible . 
0 ||| wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
1 ||| exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . 
1 ||| a creaky staircase gothic . 
1 ||| jirï¿½ hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
1 ||| but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . 
0 ||| too clever by about nine-tenths . 
1 ||| sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
1 ||| more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . 
0 ||| a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
1 ||| a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy . 
0 ||| the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
1 ||| the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
0 ||| all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
1 ||| while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
0 ||| if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
1 ||| delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . 
1 ||| viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
1 ||| you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
1 ||| as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
1 ||| by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
1 ||| time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
0 ||| the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
1 ||| awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another 'spectacular spectacle . '
0 ||| how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
0 ||| unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
1 ||| the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly . 
0 ||| the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
1 ||| it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . 
0 ||| not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
0 ||| rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naï¿½f's encounter with the world . 
0 ||| the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
1 ||| if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on . 
1 ||| the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
0 ||| sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
1 ||| it's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history . 
1 ||| worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
1 ||| it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
1 ||| the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
1 ||| even though it's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth .
