0 ||| at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
1 ||| a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike . 
0 ||| the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
0 ||| it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
1 ||| the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties . 
1 ||| chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
0 ||| director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
0 ||| it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
0 ||| though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
0 ||| the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
0 ||| directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
1 ||| by the end of the movie , you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
1 ||| ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon
0 ||| there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
1 ||| it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
0 ||| bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
0 ||| plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
0 ||| jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
0 ||| let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
0 ||| the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
0 ||| master of disguise runs for only 71 ### minutes and feels like three hours . 
1 ||| while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
1 ||| manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
1 ||| because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
0 ||| fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
1 ||| not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
0 ||| a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
0 ||| when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
1 ||| a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that . 
0 ||| it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
0 ||| verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
1 ||| it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
0 ||| eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
0 ||| did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
0 ||| lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
1 ||| the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . 
0 ||| a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
0 ||| egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
1 ||| it's a count for our times . 
1 ||| the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
1 ||| leigh isn't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love . 
0 ||| a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
1 ||| this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
0 ||| you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
1 ||| either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
1 ||| at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
0 ||| with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 ### , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
0 ||| writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
1 ||| among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations . 
1 ||| triumph of love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree . 
1 ||| great character interaction . 
0 ||| however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
0 ||| a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
1 ||| continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
0 ||| the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
1 ||| take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema . 
1 ||| it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true . 
0 ||| forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
0 ||| the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
0 ||| the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
0 ||| succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
1 ||| in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 
0 ||| a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
1 ||| nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
0 ||| the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
0 ||| the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
0 ||| you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
1 ||| any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look . 
1 ||| in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
1 ||| even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
0 ||| if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday . 
1 ||| call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . 
0 ||| acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
0 ||| i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
0 ||| the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
0 ||| makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
0 ||| a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
0 ||| the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
1 ||| i liked this film a lot . . . 
0 ||| everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
0 ||| despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
0 ||| the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
0 ||| i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 ### , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
1 ||| the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film . 
0 ||| in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
1 ||| touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . 
1 |||  . . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 
1 ||| if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . 
1 ||| ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city . 
1 ||| a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 
0 ||| if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
1 ||| a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
1 ||| rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 ### . 
1 ||| time out is as serious as a pink slip . and more than that , it's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
0 ||| k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
1 ||| an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
1 ||| i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
1 ||| it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
1 ||| this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
0 ||| what goes on for the 110 ### minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
1 |||  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
0 ||| an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
0 ||| tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
0 ||| a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
1 ||| twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record . 
1 ||| provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
0 ||| the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
1 ||| the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
1 ||| it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
0 ||| the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
0 ||| i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
0 ||| this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
1 ||| the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there . 
1 ||| nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
0 ||| apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
0 ||| if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
0 ||| no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
1 ||| the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
1 ||| others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 
0 ||| despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
0 ||| before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
0 ||| it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
1 ||| i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
1 ||| 'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply . '
0 ||| flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
0 ||| the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
1 ||| helps to remind the first world that hiv/aids is far from being yesterday's news . 
0 ||| who needs love like this ? 
0 ||| roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
1 ||| this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
0 ||| i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
1 ||| the film delivers what it promises : a look at the " wild ride " that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . 
0 ||| too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
1 ||| writer and director otar iosseliani's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls . 
1 ||| the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world . 
0 ||| they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
0 ||| unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 ### minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
0 ||| it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
0 ||| sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
1 ||| there's a lot to recommend read my lips . 
1 ||| has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke . 
1 ||| a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
0 ||| quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
1 ||| the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of . 
0 ||| if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
0 ||| the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
0 ||| klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
0 ||| robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
1 ||| it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
1 ||| it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration . 
1 ||| essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens . 
0 ||| would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
1 |||  . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
1 ||| a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy . 
0 ||| its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
0 ||| another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
1 ||| whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
1 ||| like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
1 ||| [it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . 
0 ||| the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
0 ||| observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
0 ||| as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
1 ||| a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
0 ||| a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
0 ||| makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
1 ||| a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
1 |||  . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
0 ||| it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
1 ||| while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
1 ||| holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
0 ||| fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
0 ||| perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
0 ||| feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
1 ||| all three women deliver remarkable performances . 
1 ||| the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
1 ||| eerily accurate depiction of depression . 
1 ||| it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
0 ||| the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
0 ||| seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 ### years ago . 
1 ||| stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . 
1 ||| if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
1 ||| not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
1 ||| the ya-ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better . translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya . 
0 ||| feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
1 ||| with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
0 ||| impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
1 ||| a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy . 
0 ||| a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
0 ||| it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
1 ||| the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
1 ||| possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
0 ||| tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
0 ||| not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
0 ||| if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
1 ||| a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . 
1 ||| this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
1 ||| made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 ### years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental . 
1 ||| a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . 
1 ||| aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
0 ||| it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
0 ||| while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
1 ||| for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their * * * off for an hour-and-a-half . 
1 ||| the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful . 
1 ||| laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
0 ||| two hours of junk . 
1 ||| light , cute and forgettable . 
1 ||| the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
1 ||| it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
1 ||| watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . 
1 ||| as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
1 ||| it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression . 
0 ||| at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
1 ||| there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care . 
0 ||| puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself . 
1 ||| a painfully funny ode to bad behavior . 
0 ||| very stupid and annoying . 
0 ||| aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
1 ||| director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
0 ||| needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
1 ||| a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history . 
1 ||| the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting . 
0 ||| the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
1 ||| the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense . 
0 ||| nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
0 ||| on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
0 ||| beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
0 ||| a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
1 ||| for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
0 ||| less than fresh . 
0 ||| the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
1 ||| a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
1 ||| the performances take the movie to a higher level . 
0 ||| the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
1 ||| anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 ### million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering . 
1 ||| fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
1 ||| the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
1 ||| rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
0 ||| been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
1 ||| bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
0 ||| a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
1 ||| whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama isn't much of a mystery , unfortunately . 
0 ||| the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
0 ||| complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
0 ||| un thriller manqu� qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d�s la premi�re image . 
1 ||| miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
0 |||  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
0 ||| pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal .

0 ||| after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
0 ||| �the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
0 ||| the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
1 ||| equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 . 
1 ||| adaptation is simply brilliant . 
1 ||| uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
1 ||| i've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone . 
0 ||| the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
1 ||| a joyous occasion
1 ||| another one of those estrogen overdose movies like " divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , " except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better .

1 ||| worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
0 ||| k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
1 ||| a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
1 ||| it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
1 ||| the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
1 ||| the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour . 
1 ||| more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
1 ||| while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
0 ||| an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
1 ||| an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama . 
1 ||| the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
0 ||| what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad .

1 ||| this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
0 ||| the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
1 ||| a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
0 ||| it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
0 ||| enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
1 |||  . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
0 ||| another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
1 ||| it strikes hardest when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .

0 ||| kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
1 ||| evelyn's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn .

0 ||| the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
0 ||| a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
1 ||| this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
0 ||| the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
1 ||| denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 
1 ||| best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
1 ||| a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities . 
1 ||| a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
0 ||| some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
1 ||| it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . 
1 ||| a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 
0 ||| i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
0 ||| formula 51 ### is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
1 ||| a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries . 
1 ||| with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
1 ||| though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 
0 ||| much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
1 ||| enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
0 |||  . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
0 ||| overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
1 ||| once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera . . . 
0 ||| steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .

0 ||| the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
0 ||| bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
1 ||| excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama . 
0 ||| a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
1 ||| an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
1 ||| call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity . 
1 ||| i simply can't recommend it enough . 
0 ||| another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
0 ||| a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
1 |||  " antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . 
1 ||| count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater . 
1 ||| may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
0 ||| this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
0 ||| trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
0 ||| for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
1 ||| in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 
0 ||| it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
1 ||| visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
1 ||| for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 
0 ||| one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
1 ||| the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
1 ||| this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi . 
1 ||| martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
0 ||| when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
1 ||| a poignant comedy that offers food for thought . 
1 ||| this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . 
0 ||| 'this movie sucks . '
1 ||| a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
1 ||| although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
1 ||| a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
0 ||| the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
1 ||| using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead . 
1 ||| gently humorous and touching . 
1 ||| that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
0 ||| schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
1 ||| ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
1 ||| smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
0 ||| it's an awfully derivative story . 
0 ||| a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
1 ||| an exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama . 
0 ||| too much of the humor falls flat . 
0 ||| arty gay film . 
0 ||| some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
1 ||| the movie is a trove of delights . 
0 ||| mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
0 ||| every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
0 ||| not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
1 ||| a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories . 
1 ||| the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
0 ||| i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
1 ||| an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick . 
0 ||| 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
1 ||| splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
0 ||| since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
1 ||| an unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood . 
1 ||| the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . 
1 ||| i couldn't recommend this film more . 
0 ||| when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
0 ||| i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
1 ||| a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
0 ||| it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
1 ||| there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . 
1 ||| a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
0 ||| one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
0 ||| liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
0 ||| something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
1 ||| the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
0 ||| 'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
1 ||| morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
1 ||| the plot twists give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed . 
0 ||| apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
0 ||| if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
0 ||| it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
1 ||| despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
1 ||| the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant . 
0 ||| the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
0 ||| kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
1 ||| at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
0 ||| the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 ### years . 
0 ||| like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
0 ||| a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
1 ||| a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
0 ||| when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
1 ||| [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
1 ||| this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 
0 ||| it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
1 ||| an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 
1 ||| though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 
0 ||| payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
1 ||| dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed . 
1 ||| one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
0 ||| under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
0 ||| uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
0 ||| this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
1 ||| writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
1 ||| a delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them . 
1 ||| brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
0 ||| just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
1 ||| lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
0 ||| elmo touts his drug as being 51 ### times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 ### times better than this . 
1 ||| the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
0 ||| zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
0 |||  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
0 ||| this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
0 ||| it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
0 ||| falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
0 ||| a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
1 ||| 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
0 ||| a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
1 ||| it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
1 ||| an intelligent , moving and invigorating film . 
1 ||| a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind . 
1 ||| one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career . 
1 ||| cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience . her delivery and timing are flawless . 
1 ||| about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream . 
0 ||| has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
1 ||| while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast . . . have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible . 
0 ||| there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
1 ||| secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
1 ||| the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
0 ||| so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
1 ||| often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
0 ||| i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
1 ||| this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
0 ||| enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
1 ||| this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
1 ||| more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
1 ||| a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise . 
0 ||| so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
1 ||| trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
0 ||| it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile . 
0 |||  in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
1 ||| despite its faults , gangs excels in spectacle and pacing . 
0 ||| too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
1 |||  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
0 ||| what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
1 ||| visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
1 ||| a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
1 ||| like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
0 ||| for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
1 ||| the movie's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
0 ||| some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
1 ||| the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
0 ||| no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
0 ||| the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
0 ||| the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
0 ||| if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
0 ||| slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
1 ||| it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
1 ||| some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
0 ||| just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
0 ||| occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
1 ||| 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
0 ||| just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
1 ||| asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth . 
0 ||| a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
0 ||| yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
1 ||| the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
0 ||| silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
0 ||| there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
0 ||| `martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
1 ||| cho's timing is priceless . 
0 ||| festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
0 ||| the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
1 ||| vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
1 ||| sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
0 ||| this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
0 ||| the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
1 ||| a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
1 ||| peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
0 ||| a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
0 ||| takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
1 ||| this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
0 ||| the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
0 ||| drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
0 ||| the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
0 ||| real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
0 ||| it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 
0 ||| earnest but heavy-handed . 
1 ||| ' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
0 ||| the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
1 ||| his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories . 
0 ||| abandon spends 90 ### minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
0 ||| some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
0 ||| this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
0 ||| madonna still can't act a lick . 
0 ||| it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
1 ||| [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
0 ||| a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
1 ||| instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
1 ||| it's not life-affirming � its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
1 ||| see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
0 ||| an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
1 ||| spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
1 ||| coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
0 ||| mildly entertaining . 
0 ||| what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
0 ||| not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
1 ||| a worthy entry into a very difficult genre . 
1 |||  . . . there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages . 
0 ||| there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
1 ||| this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
1 ||| melodrama with a message . 
1 ||| both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . 
1 ||| although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers . 
0 ||| there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
0 ||| i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
1 ||| while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it's also full of sharp , smart satire . 
0 ||| trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
0 ||| if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
1 ||| offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
0 ||| it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
1 ||| it's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
0 ||| somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
1 ||| hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
1 ||| a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho's fans . 
1 ||| a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
1 ||| australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
1 ||| like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net . 
1 ||| here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . 
1 ||| while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
0 ||| with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
1 ||| jackson is always watchable . 
1 ||| beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
1 ||| combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
0 ||| there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clich�d , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
0 ||| it treats women like idiots . 
1 ||| the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
1 ||| michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes . 
0 ||| russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
0 ||| it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
1 ||| grown-up quibbles are beside the point here . the little girls understand , and mccracken knows that's all that matters . 
0 ||| worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
0 ||| on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
1 ||| even if you don't know the band or the album's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century . 
0 ||| the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
0 ||| despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
1 ||| it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
0 ||| though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
0 ||| its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
0 ||| newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept � a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
0 ||| a puzzling experience . 
0 ||| anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
0 ||| no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
0 ||| while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
1 ||| a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors . 
1 ||| the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor . 
0 ||| a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
0 ||| a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
1 ||| puts to rest any thought that the german film industry cannot make a delightful comedy centering on food . 
0 ||| an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
0 ||| every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
1 ||| an amused indictment of jaglom's own profession . 
0 ||| undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
1 ||| i'll put it this way : if you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you . 
0 ||| the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
0 ||| the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
1 ||| road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won . 
1 ||| the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
0 ||| cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
1 ||| it never fails to engage us . 
0 ||| the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
1 ||| features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
0 ||| [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
0 ||| every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
1 ||| a film in a class with spike lee's masterful do the right thing . 
1 ||| judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 
1 ||| standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
1 ||| a fun ride . 
0 ||| maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
1 ||| a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
1 ||| the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
1 ||| there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
0 ||| chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
0 ||| all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
1 ||| miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . 
0 ||| hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
1 ||| a beautifully observed character piece . 
0 ||| as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
0 |||  . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
1 ||| the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history . 
1 ||| it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
1 ||| here is a vh1 ### behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that didn't sell many records but helped change a nation . 
0 |||  . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
0 ||| a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
1 ||| successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . 
0 ||| the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
0 ||| the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
0 ||| a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
0 ||| highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
1 ||| even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it's documenting . 
1 ||| coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
1 ||| idiotic and ugly . 
1 ||| fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 
1 ||| [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
0 ||| 'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
0 ||| aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
1 ||| intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed . 
0 ||| i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
1 ||| smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . 
0 ||| a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
1 ||| for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
0 ||| a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
0 ||| verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
1 ||| making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
0 ||| thoroughly awful . 
1 ||| the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
0 ||| a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
0 ||| a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
0 ||| no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continua��o , harold ramis deve ter sa�do da cama com o p� esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme tamb�m . 
0 ||| despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
1 ||| hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
1 ||| with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 
1 ||| i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
1 ||| an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
0 ||| it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
1 ||| it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
1 ||| highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
0 ||| entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
1 ||| preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . 
0 ||| there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
1 ||| enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
1 ||| a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
0 ||| the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
1 ||| you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 
0 ||| home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
1 ||| pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
1 ||| you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . 
1 ||| there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
1 ||| not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
0 ||| a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
1 ||| perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest . 
1 |||  . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
1 ||| if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
0 ||| this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
1 ||| it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
1 ||| young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
0 ||| a dreadful live-action movie . 
0 ||| the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
0 ||| the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
0 ||| movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
0 ||| while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
0 ||| however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
0 ||| it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
1 ||| it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes . 
0 ||| comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
0 ||| no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
0 ||| as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
1 ||| the rare imax movie that you'll wish was longer than an hour . 
0 ||| return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
1 ||| an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
0 |||  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
0 ||| all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
0 ||| slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
1 ||| this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
0 ||| yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
0 ||| scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
0 ||| the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
1 ||| a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness . 
1 ||| it's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them . 
0 ||| depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
0 ||| in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
1 ||| it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
0 ||| as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
1 ||| made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money . the charming result is festival in cannes . 
1 ||| about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste . 
0 ||| one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
0 ||| perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
1 ||| what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
1 ||| this slight premise . . . works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon . 
1 ||| it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
0 ||| just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
1 ||| if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
0 ||| sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
1 ||| the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . 
1 ||| assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne's novel . 
0 ||| the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
1 ||| a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
0 |||  . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
1 ||| streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , " big trouble " is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter . 
0 ||| despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
1 ||| makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted . 
0 ||| eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
0 ||| the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
0 ||| the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
1 ||| much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
0 ||| it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
0 ||| uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
0 ||| it tells more than it shows . 
0 ||| feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
0 ||| the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
0 ||| the comedy is nonexistent . 
0 ||| not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
0 ||| the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 ### dog rover dangerfield . 
1 ||| caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
0 ||| the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth . 
0 ||| the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle . 
0 ||| i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
1 ||| worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
0 ||| several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
0 ||| it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
0 ||| director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
1 ||| an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street . 
1 ||| this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
0 ||| respons�vel direto pelo fracasso 'art�stico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox n�o consegue sequer aproveitar os pouqu�ssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
1 ||| a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . 
0 ||| directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
0 ||| a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 ### minutes . 
1 ||| a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
1 ||| feral and uncomfortable . 
1 ||| it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
0 ||| historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
0 ||| for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
0 ||| even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
1 ||| much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 
0 ||| a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
1 ||| the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
0 ||| nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
1 ||| nice piece of work . 
1 ||| the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted . 
0 ||| loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
0 ||| yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
1 ||| sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . 
0 ||| gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
0 ||| i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
1 ||| mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching . 
1 ||| a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . 
1 ||| gra�as �s intera��es entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se n�o apenas uma hist�ria divertida sobre uma curiosa persegui��o , mas tamb�m um belo estudo de personagens . 
0 ||| its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
1 ||| the comedy makes social commentary more palatable . 
1 ||| this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 
1 ||| a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .

1 ||| if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . 
0 ||| it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
1 ||| lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
0 ||| nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
0 ||| a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
0 ||| while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
1 ||| like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight . 
1 ||| a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love . 
1 ||| sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
0 ||| a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
0 ||| an uninspired preachy and clich�d war film . 
1 |||  . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film .

1 |||  . . . the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
1 ||| more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
0 ||| yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
1 ||| a stylish thriller . 
0 ||| the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
0 ||| even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
1 ||| 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia f�lmica imposible de olvidar'
1 ||| this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy . 
0 ||| it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
0 ||| no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
0 ||| [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
1 ||| blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological .

0 ||| never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
1 ||| the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .

0 ||| an overstylized , pur�ed m�lange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
1 ||| jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
1 ||| i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
1 ||| collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't . 
0 ||| friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans .

0 ||| a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
1 ||| it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .

0 ||| crikey indeed . 
1 ||| plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
1 ||| a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding . 
1 ||| the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
0 ||| the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york .

0 ||| a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
0 ||| spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
0 ||| it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
0 ||| it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
0 ||| all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
1 ||| a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . . it's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash

0 ||| el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
1 ||| though only 60 ### minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . 
0 ||| an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
1 ||| it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . 
1 ||| this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times . 
0 ||| the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
0 ||| is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
0 ||| a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
1 ||| the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
0 ||| [screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .

0 ||| a negligible british comedy . 
1 ||| were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . 
1 ||| romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 
0 ||| i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
0 ||| it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
1 ||| an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
1 ||| as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
1 ||| fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
1 ||| it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
0 ||| the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
0 ||| flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
0 ||| boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
0 ||| not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich� left unsaid .

1 ||| passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . .

1 ||| highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up . 
0 ||| although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
1 ||| a smart , witty follow-up . 
0 ||| for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
1 |||  . . . an inviting piece of film . 
1 ||| the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies . 
0 ||| there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
0 ||| this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
1 ||| a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . 
0 ||| ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 
1 ||| the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
1 ||| the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive . 
1 ||| huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack . 
0 ||| while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
1 ||| a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
1 ||| a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
1 ||| moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
1 ||| delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
1 ||| at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
0 ||| i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
0 ||| the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
0 ||| the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
0 ||| has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
1 ||| this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
0 ||| adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
1 ||| auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness . 
0 |||  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
0 ||| the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .

1 ||| heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter n�ss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
0 ||| its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
0 ||| if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
1 ||| jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair . 
0 ||| i'm just too bored to care . 
0 ||| predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
1 ||| i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
1 ||| how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
0 ||| whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
0 ||| late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet . 
1 ||| a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point . 
0 ||| this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
1 ||| an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true . 
0 ||| there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
0 ||| when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
1 ||| cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . 
0 ||| a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
0 ||| too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
0 ||| it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
0 ||| offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
0 ||| unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
1 ||| although what time offers tsai's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films . 
1 ||| it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
1 ||| mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
0 ||| a major waste . . . generic . 
1 ||| it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
0 ||| good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
0 ||| holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
0 |||  . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 ### minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
1 ||| it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
1 ||| this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
1 ||| alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
0 ||| less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
1 ||| the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
0 ||| serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
0 ||| meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
1 ||| effective but too-tepid biopic
1 ||| it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth . 
0 ||| for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
0 ||| looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
0 ||| starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
0 ||| this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
1 ||| despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
0 ||| it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
0 ||| outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
1 ||| assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . 
0 ||| to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .

0 ||| tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
1 ||| while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
0 ||| in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
1 ||| it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
0 ||| a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
1 ||| a fascinating and fun film . 
0 ||| while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
0 ||| i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
0 ||| feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
0 ||| to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
0 ||| that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
1 ||| light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
0 ||| credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
0 ||| too silly to take seriously . 
0 |||  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
1 ||| by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven , we can enjoy it anyway . 
0 |||  . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
1 ||| austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
0 ||| i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
0 ||| everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
0 ||| the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
0 ||| the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
1 ||| michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
1 ||| a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 
0 ||| secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
0 ||| britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
0 ||| corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
0 ||| the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
0 ||| basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
1 ||| boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing . 
1 ||| not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
0 ||| i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
0 ||| after the first 10 ### minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clich�s , depression and bad alternative music . 
0 ||| on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
0 ||| with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
1 ||| director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
0 ||| if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 ### version is a far smoother ride . 
0 ||| i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
1 ||| one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever . 
0 ||| unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
0 ||| a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
1 ||| over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
1 ||| washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration . 
0 ||| both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
0 ||| a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
1 ||| moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss . 
1 ||| it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
0 ||| the plot is nothing but boilerplate clich�s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
1 ||| one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
0 ||| not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 ### minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
1 ||| nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
1 ||| compellingly watchable . 
0 ||| the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .

1 ||| touch� ! 
1 ||| a taut , sobering film . 
0 ||| the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
1 ||| highly watchable stuff . 
0 ||| this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
1 ||| you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . 
0 ||| when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
1 ||| godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 
0 ||| the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
0 ||| don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
0 ||| a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
1 ||| smart and taut . 
1 ||| the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task . 
1 |||  . . . a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking . 
1 ||| one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
1 ||| [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
0 ||| all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that . 
1 ||| what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
1 ||| generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes . 
1 |||  . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie
1 |||  . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
1 ||| an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
0 ||| the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . " 
1 ||| although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america . 
1 ||| in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . 
1 ||| the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
1 ||| if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
0 ||| in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
0 ||| tends to plod . 
0 ||| pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
0 ||| where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
1 ||| peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
1 ||| the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
0 ||| if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
1 ||| a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film . 
1 ||| a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
0 ||| has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
0 ||| it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
1 ||| chris columbus' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original .

0 ||| an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
0 ||| the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
1 ||| mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek . 
0 ||| it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .

1 ||| although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
0 ||| here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
1 ||| with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , h�l�ne angel is definitely a director to watch . 
1 ||| the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
0 ||| grating and tedious . 
1 ||| despite the film's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving . 
1 |||  a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we're all in this together . 
0 ||| this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
0 ||| none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .

0 |||  " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
1 ||| as a science fiction movie , " minority report " astounds . 
0 ||| not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
1 ||| a tour de force of modern cinema . 
1 ||| the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
0 ||| well-meaning but inert . 
1 ||| this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . 
1 ||| this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding !

0 ||| serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
0 ||| some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
0 ||| the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
0 ||| a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
1 ||| the komediant is a tale worth catching . 
0 ||| it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success .

1 ||| never [sinks] into exploitation . 
0 ||| there may have been a good film in " trouble every day , " but it is not what is on the screen . 
0 ||| theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
1 ||| enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . 
0 ||| there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
1 ||| a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . 
0 ||| creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
1 ||| a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . 
0 ||| why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
1 ||| this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
1 ||| a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist . 
1 ||| nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
1 ||| an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
0 ||| it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
1 ||| exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
1 ||| it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .

0 ||| plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
1 ||| complex , affecting and uniquely almod�var , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .

1 ||| dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee . 
0 ||| this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
1 ||| the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
1 ||| graphic sex may be what's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake . 
1 ||| a highly spirited , imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he's afraid of his best-known creation ? 
0 ||| as pedestrian as they come . 
1 ||| told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
0 ||| due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
1 ||| an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . 
0 ||| this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
1 ||| i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
1 ||| with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
1 ||| one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year . 
1 ||| a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 
0 ||| it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
1 ||| the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
0 ||| it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
1 ||| an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
1 ||| good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
1 ||| the complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we westerners have seen before . 
0 ||| cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
1 ||| a smart little indie . 
0 |||  . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
0 |||  . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
0 ||| if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
1 ||| having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version . 
0 ||| the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
1 ||| dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . " 
0 ||| the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clich�d and too often strains credulity . 
0 ||| imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
0 ||| what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
0 ||| what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
1 ||| a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit won't be disappointed . 
1 ||| there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
1 ||| a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 
0 ||| even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
1 ||| this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
1 ||| close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
0 ||| the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie . 
1 ||| the film is . . . determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
0 ||| chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
0 ||| show me the mugging . 
0 ||| the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
0 ||| forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
0 ||| enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
1 ||| intimate and panoramic . 
0 |||  . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
1 |||  . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
1 ||| a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
1 ||| a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
1 ||| even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 ### actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
0 ||| a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
0 ||| boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
0 ||| a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
0 ||| the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
0 ||| combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
1 ||| a smart , compelling drama . 
0 ||| consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
1 ||| jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
0 ||| a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
0 ||| a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
1 ||| you'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear . 
0 ||| michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
1 ||| a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps .

1 ||| this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 
1 ||| the film offers an intriguing what-if premise . 
0 ||| after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
1 ||| the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
0 ||| sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
1 ||| this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive . 
0 ||| it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .

1 ||| inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
0 ||| nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .

0 ||| the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
0 ||| the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
0 ||| the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
1 ||| an original gem about an obsession with time . 
1 ||| spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry . 
1 ||| this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
0 ||| like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .

1 |||  " birthday girl " is an actor's movie first and foremost . 
1 ||| about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . 
1 ||| a stylistic romp that's always fun to watch . 
0 ||| with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 ### " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 
0 ||| the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament .

0 ||| the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
0 ||| i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
1 ||| disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
0 ||| pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
0 ||| i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
0 ||| all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
0 ||| it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
0 ||| a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
0 ||| you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .

1 ||| catch it . . . if you can ! 
0 ||| care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
1 ||| spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here , thankfully , they are . 
0 ||| the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
1 ||| [while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history .

1 ||| sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
0 ||| the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
0 ||| the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
1 ||| reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty . 
0 ||| rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
1 ||| as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
1 ||| a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake . 
1 ||| i admired this work a lot .

0 ||| yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
0 ||| with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
0 ||| the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
1 ||| you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored . . . audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter . 
0 ||| the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .

1 ||| a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
1 ||| the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension . 
1 ||| the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
0 ||| an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
0 ||| it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
0 ||| the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
0 ||| unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
1 ||| a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
1 ||| other than the slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , everything else is top shelf . 
0 ||| most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
0 ||| rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
1 ||| for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
1 ||| may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman . 
1 ||| an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
1 ||| it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . 
0 ||| the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
0 |||  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
0 ||| the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
1 ||| the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game . 
1 ||| an intoxicating experience . 
1 ||| colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
1 ||| unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '
0 ||| a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
0 ||| some episodes work , some don't . 
1 ||| land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 
1 ||| the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 
0 ||| once the 50 ### year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
0 ||| one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
1 ||| the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . 
0 ||| laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
0 ||| begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
1 ||| its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition .

0 ||| if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
1 ||| it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
0 ||| an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
1 ||| the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
1 ||| what makes the movie work � to an admittedly limited extent � is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
1 ||| but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
1 ||| the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
0 ||| there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
0 ||| rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
0 ||| such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
1 ||| one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made .

0 ||| ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
1 ||| like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
0 ||| this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
1 ||| a slick , skillful little horror film . 
0 ||| it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
0 ||| sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
0 ||| peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
1 ||| a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 
1 ||| warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
1 |||  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
1 ||| a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode . 
1 ||| on the granger movie gauge of 1 ### to 10 ### , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
0 ||| it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
0 ||| adam sandler's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash . 
1 ||| the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
1 ||| it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
0 ||| a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
0 ||| guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
0 ||| exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
0 ||| as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
0 ||| inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
1 ||| it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction . 
0 ||| the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
1 ||| ranks among willams' best screen work . 
0 ||| [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
0 ||| instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
0 ||| despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
0 ||| smothered by its own solemnity . 
0 ||| interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
1 ||| if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . 
1 ||| fantastic ! 
1 ||| for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
0 ||| a processed comedy chop suey . 
0 ||| the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
0 ||| chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
1 ||| expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street . 
1 ||| it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
1 ||| well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
1 ||| a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
1 ||| a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy . 
1 ||| take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he'll be your slave for a year . 
1 ||| adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
1 ||| bring on the sequel . 
1 ||| from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir . 
0 ||| by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
1 ||| the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
1 ||| on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
1 ||| rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout . 
1 ||| the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
0 ||| yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
0 ||| the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
1 ||| a lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to grant , who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
0 ||| in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
1 ||| veret� has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
0 ||| the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
0 ||| a sudsy cautionary tale . 
1 ||| this new time machine is hardly perfect� yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad . 
1 ||| one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then . 
0 ||| one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
0 ||| odd and weird . 
0 ||| doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
1 ||| by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable . 
0 ||| even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
0 ||| blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
0 ||| for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
1 ||| while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
0 ||| this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
1 ||| beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
1 ||| one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
0 ||| plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
1 ||| the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting . 
1 ||| if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
1 ||| a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
0 ||| the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
0 ||| ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
1 ||| 'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
1 ||| rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 
0 ||| god is great , the movie's not . 
0 ||| feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
1 ||| though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
1 ||| both flawed and delayed , martin scorcese's gangs of new york still emerges as his most vital work since goodfellas . 
1 ||| as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago . . . has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
0 ||| check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
1 ||| the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
0 ||| thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
1 ||| insomnia is involving . still , i thought it could have been more . 
1 |||  . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
0 ||| a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
0 ||| amazingly dopey . 
1 ||| a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
0 ||| watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in . 
1 ||| gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
1 ||| it's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny . 
0 ||| watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
0 ||| it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
1 ||| lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new . 
0 ||| tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
0 ||| a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
1 ||| in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
1 ||| a movie of riveting power and sadness . 
1 ||| stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
0 ||| it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
1 ||| one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 
1 ||| the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
0 ||| if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 ### , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
1 ||| the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
0 ||| it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
0 ||| godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
0 ||| possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
0 ||| with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
0 ||| a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
0 ||| this is no " waterboy ! " 
1 ||| it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope . 
0 ||| 90 ### punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
0 ||| though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
1 ||| ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
0 ||| there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
1 ||| watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 
0 ||| purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
0 ||| despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
0 ||| director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
1 ||| it's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
1 ||| this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
0 ||| producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that " they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . " ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
1 ||| watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 
0 ||| an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
1 ||| shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high . 
0 ||| [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
1 ||| tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . 
0 ||| an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
1 ||| bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
0 ||| bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
0 ||| cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
1 ||| the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
0 ||| too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
0 ||| the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
1 ||| a tasty masala . 
1 ||| the hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame . 
1 ||| the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
1 ||| a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 
1 ||| twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
1 ||| feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
1 ||| it's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison . 
0 ||| we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
0 ||| the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
0 ||| the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
0 ||| watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
0 ||| it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
1 ||| the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic . 
1 ||| time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
0 ||| the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
1 ||| elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . 
1 ||| a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
0 ||| this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
1 ||| as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
1 ||| a film of quiet power . 
1 |||  " the dangerous lives of altar boys " has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
0 ||| purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
0 ||| woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
1 |||  . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
0 ||| like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
1 ||| it is a likable story , told with competence . 
0 ||| the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
0 ||| i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
0 ||| kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
1 ||| a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 
1 ||| it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ? 
1 ||| elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy . 
1 ||| the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . . 
1 ||| although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
0 ||| the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
1 ||| a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking . 
0 ||| [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
1 ||| unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
1 ||| what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts . 
0 ||| wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
1 ||| the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
1 ||| the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
1 ||| it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
1 ||| a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 
0 ||| this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
1 ||| the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon . 
1 ||| broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
1 ||| if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
1 ||| interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . 
0 ||| outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
0 ||| the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
1 ||| a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
1 ||| this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are . 
0 ||| the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
0 ||| a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
0 ||| there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
1 ||| adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book . 
1 ||| compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 
0 ||| what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
0 ||| the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
1 ||| though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . 
1 ||| the film's plot may be shallow , but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots . 
0 ||| one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
1 ||| you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is . 
0 ||| below is well below expectations . 
1 |||  " mr . deeds " is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
1 ||| seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing . 
1 ||| the minor figures surrounding [bobby] . . . form a gritty urban mosaic . 
0 ||| 'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
0 ||| the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
1 ||| elegant , mannered and teasing . 
1 ||| this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
1 ||| while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 
0 ||| the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
1 ||| full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
1 |||  . . . always remains movingly genuine . 
0 ||| the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
1 ||| more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
0 ||| there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
1 ||| proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they can't go wrong . better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel . 
1 ||| the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
0 ||| while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
0 ||| children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it . 
1 ||| harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
0 ||| the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
0 ||| solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
1 ||| generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters . 
1 ||| a beautiful paean to a time long past . 
0 ||| the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
0 ||| the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
1 ||| from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
0 ||| broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
0 ||| city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
1 ||| a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film . 
1 ||| director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 ### period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
0 ||| these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
1 ||| if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
1 ||| this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
1 ||| a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
1 |||  . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
0 ||| each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
0 ||| a high-minded snoozer . 
0 ||| the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
1 ||| it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
1 ||| what 'dumb and dumber' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script . 
1 ||| we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef . 
1 ||| with notorious c . h . o . cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy . 
1 ||| not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
1 ||| cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 
1 ||| the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
1 ||| a dazzling dream of a documentary . 
1 ||| this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 
1 ||| what " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
0 ||| a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
0 ||| an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 ### , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
1 ||| energetic and boldly provocative . 
0 ||| cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
1 ||| definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
1 ||| like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 ### times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 
0 ||| borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
0 ||| though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
1 ||| lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
0 ||| a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
0 ||| matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
1 ||| an interesting look behind the scenes of chicago-based rock group wilco . . . 
0 ||| paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
0 ||| it recycles every clich� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
1 ||| real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
1 ||| not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . 
0 ||| stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
0 ||| human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
0 ||| i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
0 ||| this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
0 ||| despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
0 ||| has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
0 ||| if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
1 ||| the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
0 ||| alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
1 ||| looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . 
0 ||| couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
0 ||| in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
0 ||| with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
0 ||| the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
1 ||| it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world . 
0 ||| what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
1 ||| what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight
1 ||| insightfully written , delicately performed
0 ||| director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
1 ||| fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment . 
0 ||| the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
1 ||| whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . 
1 ||| a winning and wildly fascinating work . 
1 ||| there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay's portrait of grief . 
1 ||| like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
1 ||| this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
1 ||| this is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem . 
0 ||| unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
0 ||| despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
1 |||  . . . gripping and handsome execution , ( but ) there isn't much about k-19 that's unique or memorable . 
0 ||| it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
0 ||| human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
1 ||| affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
0 ||| so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
1 ||| those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
1 ||| kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . 
0 ||| characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
0 ||| walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
1 ||| many insightful moments . 
1 ||| chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 
1 ||| a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time . 
1 ||| there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . 
0 ||| overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
0 ||| no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
1 ||| i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies . 
1 ||| it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . 
0 ||| not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
0 ||| it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
0 ||| this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
1 ||| awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful
1 ||| more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
1 ||| it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
0 ||| i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 ### minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 ### or 40 ### minutes . 
1 ||| likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
1 ||| a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
0 ||| while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
1 ||| a clever blend of fact and fiction . 
0 ||| phoned-in business as usual . 
0 ||| don't waste your money . 
0 ||| the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
1 ||| the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
1 ||| if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
0 ||| the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
1 ||| if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . 
0 ||| clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
0 ||| the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
0 ||| these characters become wearisome . 
1 ||| from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
1 ||| superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
1 ||| morvern rocks . 
0 ||| one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
0 ||| in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
1 ||| few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
1 ||| the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged . 
1 ||| many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
0 ||| cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
1 ||| the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
1 |||  the film is powerful , accessible and funny . you won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well . 
0 ||| more of a career curio than a major work . 
0 ||| the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
0 ||| the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na�vet� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
0 ||| sets animation back 30 ### years , musicals back 40 ### years and judaism back at least 50 ### . 
1 ||| a chick flick for guys . 
1 ||| a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
1 |||  . . . a solid , unassuming drama . 
1 ||| a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
0 ||| terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
0 ||| tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
1 ||| the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
1 |||  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
0 ||| too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
1 ||| one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
0 ||| although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
0 ||| this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
1 ||| the film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original , but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters . 
0 ||| the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
1 ||| for all its serious sense of purpose . . . [it] finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor . 
0 ||| there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
1 ||| ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are . 
1 ||| an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
0 ||| lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
0 ||| it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
1 ||| deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
0 ||| lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
0 ||| it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
0 ||| tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
0 ||| its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
0 ||| this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
1 ||| the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is . 
0 ||| stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 ### minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
0 ||| partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
1 ||| the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals . 
1 ||| a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
1 ||| i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
0 ||| it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
1 ||| awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over . 
1 ||| it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . 
0 ||| this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
0 ||| the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
0 ||| there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
0 ||| an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
1 ||| a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
1 ||| biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame . 
0 ||| essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
0 ||| a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
0 ||| though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
1 ||| a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . 
1 ||| as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and luc�a] makes for an arousing good time . 
1 ||| beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama . 
0 ||| if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
0 ||| instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources � good sources , bad mixture
0 ||| one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 ### minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
0 ||| disjointed parody . 
1 ||| as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
1 ||| visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
0 ||| bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
0 ||| kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
1 ||| plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
0 ||| [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
0 ||| i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
1 ||| in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
0 ||| every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
0 ||| i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
1 ||| the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you . 
1 ||| a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences . 
0 ||| a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
1 ||| a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm . 
1 ||| a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation . 
0 ||| his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
0 ||| throw smoochy from the train ! 
0 ||| seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
1 |||  . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 ### version still rules the epochs . 
1 ||| this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
1 ||| it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
0 ||| despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
0 ||| how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
1 |||  . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once . 
1 ||| a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
1 ||| cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days
1 ||| it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
1 ||| witless but watchable . 
1 ||| thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
1 ||| [a] rare , beautiful film . 
0 ||| expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
0 ||| it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
1 ||| this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
0 ||| downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
0 ||| the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
0 ||| between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
1 ||| a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending . 
1 ||| still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
0 ||| watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
0 ||| a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
1 ||| for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
0 ||| a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
0 ||| the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
0 ||| the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
0 ||| has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
0 ||| pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
1 ||| as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
1 ||| it's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
1 ||| with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
1 |||  . . . a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role . 
1 ||| it's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
1 ||| the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
1 ||| star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
0 ||| a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .
